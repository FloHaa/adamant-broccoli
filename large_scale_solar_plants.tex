\chapter{Large scale solar power plants}
Almost all power that we use on our planet comes from the sun. Direct in form of radiation or indirect during wind, water and vegetation. Also the fossil power resources and reserves are stored energy from the sun in from of organic carbon compounds. There are two main technologies for generating electricity out of direct sun radiation. One is the direct conversion of solar irradiance to electrical energy while using photovoltaic. The other is to generate heat and convert it to electrical power. Figure~\ref{OverviewSTP} gives an abstract of the common technologies using direct solar power to generating electric power. This chapter has the focus on large-scale solar power plants and describes parts from both technologies.

Therefore it is split in the technology fields of large scale concentrated solar power plants (\ref{Large scale concentrated solar power (CSP) plants}) and large scale photo voltaic power plants (\ref{Large scale photo voltaic (PV) power plants}).
In detail the technologies with a large-scale power plant potential -- parabolic trough, central receiver and non-concentrating photovoltaic -- are described. Also the storage systems for both systems. 

\section{Large-scale CSP plants}\label{Large scale concentrated solar power (CSP) plants}
Concentrating solar power (CSP) systems use combinations of mirrors or lenses to concentrate direct beam solar radiation to produce forms of useful energy such as heat, electricity and others. This happens by use of various downstream technologies. Generally the CSP technology includes not only the concentrating solar thermal (CST) technology, but also concentrating photovoltaic (CPV) energy conversion. However, there is no focus on CPV in this thesis. That is why the term CST is put on a level with CSP.

A CSP plant comprises four main sub-systems: concentrating system, solar receiver, storage and power block. Also supplementary firing is used in some cases, but is basically not necessary nowadays. A graphic scheme of such a sub-system is shown in Figure~\ref{MainComp}. The separate components are linked together by energy flow in mostly radiation transfer or fluid transport. This chapter describes the function and gives an application overview of the individually components.

The main advantage of CSP in opposite to other renewable energy producers is the thermal storage to provide power for cloudy days or during night time. Therefore the concentrating system and solar receiver have to produce more thermal energy then the power block can use directly. The ratio of the power capacity of the collector field to the capacity of the power block is defined as Solar multiple (SM). For CSP systems with storage, the number of hours of storage is based on the capacity of the power block. Chapter \ref{Subsection_storage_system} describes technical possibilities and application of thermal storage system for CSP.



The solar receiver or concentrating system is eponymously for the main CST technologies. The two most common CSP plant technologies are parabolic trough collector (PTC) and central receiver (CR) systems (also known as solar power towers). Further types of CSP plant are linear Fresnel reflectors (LFR) and parabolic dish. The main difference of the technologies is the concentrating system. Thereof results the differences in optical design, shape of receiver, nature of the transfer fluid and capability to store heat before it is turned into electricity. In systems with a line focus (PTC trough and LFR) the mirrors track the sun along one axis. In those with a point focus (CR and parabolic dish), the mirrors track the sun along two axes. The receiver may be fixed, as in LFR and CR, or mobile as in PTC and parabolic dish systems. An overview of the technologies and there differences in relation to the focus and the receiver  is shown in Table \ref{tbl: CSPtech}.

    Fixed receivers are stationary devices that remain independent of the plantâ€™s focusing device. This eases the transport of collected heat to the power block.

\end{table}


As mentioned above is main difference between the CSP technology families how they concentrate the solar radiation. This strongly affects their overall efficiency. The parabolic dish has the best annual optical efficiency (about 90\%) because the concentrator axis is always parallel to the sun rays. The worst (about 50\%) is observed for linear Fresnel systems because of poor performance in the morning and in the evening. Intermediate values (65-75\%) are obtained for parabolic trough and tower systems. For each family the actual efficiency varies with the location, the time of day and the season of the year. \cite{EASAC2011} 



The capacity range of an CSP-plant is also strongly affected by the concentration ratio. The most common definition of concentration ratio is the ratio of the area of reflector aperture ($A_a$) to the area of receiver ($A_r$). The area concentration is:
\begin{align}
C=\frac{A_{a}}{A_{r}} \label{GL_concentration}
\end{align}
The concentration ratio from Equation \ref{GL_concentration} has an upper limit that depends on whether the concentration is a three dimensional (point focus) concentrator such as a parabolic dish and central receiver solar tower or a two-dimensional (linear focus) concentrator such as parabolic trough and linear Fresnel reflector. The maximum concentration ratio is based on the second law of thermodynamics applied to radiative heat exchange between the sun and the receiver. The maximum possible concentration ratio for circular concentrators is 45~000, and for linear concentrators is the maximum 212. \cite{Duffie2013}

But actually the technical implementation of concentration ratio is the main parameter for the capacity range of a CSP plant. Table~\ref{tbl: CSPCharacteristics} gives an overview of some of the performance characteristics of the concentrating solar power concepts. More details are listed in Annexure I, Part A, Figure~\ref{CSPOverview1} on Page~\pageref{CSPOverview1} and Figure~\ref{CSPOverview2} on Page~\pageref{CSPOverview2}. PTC, LFR, and CR can be coupled to steam cycles of 10-280~MW electric capacity (and more), with thermal cycle efficiencies of 30-45~\%. Also the applies for stirling engines which are coupled to dish systems have similar efficiency ranges. The conversion efficiency of the power block remains essentially the same as in conventional-fired power plants. The annual system efficiency are the net power generation over incident beam radiation. They are lower than the conversion efficiencies of conventional steam or combined cycles, because they include the conversion of solar radiative energy to heat within the collector and the conversion of the heat to electricity in the power block. \cite{Pitz-Paal.2013}

\end{figure}

The development of the actual CSP plant technology goes back in the 1970's and 1980's, which is a consequent from the first two Oil crises. Figure~\ref{CSP_technology_development} shows the historical development of PTC, LFR in the Figure called linear Fresnel collector (LFC) and the CR (tower). The parabolic dishes have not succeeded at all and aren't shown here. The reason for that is mainly due to the high structural costs of moving an large diameter dish with two-axes tracking. One might observe that the predominant technology is the PTC, with an installed capacity well above 3~GW. CR have started the exponential development some years later compared to PTC, which explains why the operational installed capacity is much lower. Similarly the development for LFR have started even later, which drives to the lowest installed capacity of the three technologies. The difference in the timing of the three successful technologies is very influenced by the CSP development in its first golden period, the 1980's. In such period important central tower prototypes were built in USA (Solar One, Solar Two, CESA-1) and a 365~MW PTC solar plant was installed in the Mojave Desert. When the oil prices dropped at the end of the second oil crises interest on renewable energies was lost until the last decade. 

With regard to the past development in the different CSP technology dealt the following chapters with the PTC (\ref{subsection_PTC}) as well as with the solar tower technology (\ref{subsection_CRS}). The necessary concepts of the storage systems (\ref{Subsection_storage_system}) and an overview of common heat transfer fluids (\ref{subsection_HTF}) are also included. The systems for the converting thermal to electrical power will be also summarized (\ref{subsection_powerblock}).  Parabolic dishes and LFC are not further considered depending to the development stage.
