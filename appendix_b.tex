\chapter{Appendix B: Methodology for calculating the LCOE} \label{ChapterLCOE}
The LCOE is a financial value to compare different power producing technologies with different financial parameters and generation structures over a hole economical lifetime of power plants. To calculate the LCOE a simplified method from \cite{Morin2012}, originally proposed by \cite{Roy1997} was considered:
\begin{equation}
LCOE=\frac{C_{invest}\times(f_{annuity}+f_{ins.ann.})+C_{O\&M}}{E_{el,net,ann.}\times f_{avail,plant}} \label{LCOEold}
\end{equation}
This equation is commonly used for CSP plants and don't contain a degradation factor as it is necessary for the lifetime consideration of PV power plants. So the equation was extended with the average degradation factor of full observation period $f_{Full,degrad}$:

For the calculation of the LCOE of all power plants the extended equation was used:
\begin{equation}
LCOE=\frac{C_{invest}\times(f_{annuity}+f_{ins.ann.})+C_{O\&M}}{E_{el,net}\times f_{avail,plant} \times f_{Full,degrad}}\label{LCOE}
\end{equation}
with:
\begin{equation}
f_{annuity} = \frac{(1+i)^n \times i}{(1+i)^n-1} \label{annuity}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
f_{Full,degrad} = \frac{\sum\limits_{t=0}^{n-1} \frac{1}{(1+f_{degrad})^{t}}}{n} \label{GL_Degradationfactor}
\end{equation}
