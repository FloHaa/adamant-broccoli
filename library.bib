@article{Morin2012,
abstract = {The Linear Fresnel Collector (LFC) technology is currently being commercialised by several companies for the application in solar thermal power plants. This study compares the electricity generation costs for LFC and Parabolic Trough Collector (PTC). PTC is the most commercial CSP technology to date and is therefore regarded as the benchmark. For reasons of comparability, direct steam generation is assumed for both LFC and PTC. For the LFC, cost data comparable to typical CSP plant sizes are hardly available. Therefore, the break even cost - referring to aperture-specific collector investment - is determined, where cost-parity of the electricity generation with a PTC reference plant is reached. This study varies the assumptions on collector performance and operation and maintenance costs to reflect different designs of LFC technologies. The calculations were carried out using cost and hourly simulation performance models. Depending on the assumptions, the costs for a linear Fresnel collector solar field should range between 78 and 216€/m 2 to reach cost-parity at assumed reference solar field costs of 275€/m 2 for the PTC. The LFC principle of arranging the mirrors horizontally leads to lower aperture-related optical efficiency which must be compensated by lower cost per m 2 of aperture compared to PTC. The LFC is a collector with significant cost reduction potential, mainly due to cheaper mirrors and structural advantages. The presented cost and performance targets shown in this study must be met by LFC technology developers to reach the PTC benchmark. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Herrmann2004,
abstract = {The most advanced thermal energy storage for solar thermal power plants is a two-tank storage system where the heat transfer fluid (HTF) also serves as storage medium. This concept was successfully demonstrated in a commercial trough plant (13.8 MWe SEGS I plant; 120 MWht storage capacity) and a demonstration tower plant (10 MWe Solar Two; 105 MWht storage capacity). However, the HTF used in state-of-the-art parabolic trough power plants (30-80 MWe) is expensive, dramatically increasing the cost of larger HTF storage systems. An engineering study was carried out to evaluate a concept, where another (less expensive) liquid medium such as molten salt is utilized as storage medium rather than the HTF itself. Detailed performance and cost analyses were conducted to evaluate the economic value of this concept. The analyses are mainly based on the operation experience from the SEGS plants and the Solar Two project. The study concluded that the specific cost for a two-tank molten salt storage is in the range of US{\$} 30-40/kWhth depending on storage size. Since the salt storage was operated successfully in the Solar Two project, no major barriers were identified to realize this concept in the first commercial parabolic trough power plant. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {South Africa occupies a central position in the global debate regarding the most effective policy instruments to accelerate and sustain private investment in renewable energy. In 2009, the government began exploring feed-in tariffs (FITs) for renewable energy, but these were later rejected in favor of competitive tenders. The resulting program, now known as the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Program (REIPPPP), has successfully channeled substantial private sector expertise and investment into grid-connected renewable energy in South Africa at competitive prices. To date, a total of 64 projects have been awarded to the private sector, and the first projects are already on line. Private sector investment totaling US{\$}14 billion has been committed, and these projects will generate 3922 megawatt (MW) of renewable power. Prices have dropped over the three bidding phases with average solar photovoltaic (PV) tariffs decreasing by 68 percent and wind dropping by 42 percent, in nominal terms. Most impressively, these achievements all occurred over a two-and-a-half year period. Finally, there have been notable improvements in the economic development commitments, primarily benefiting rural communities. One investor characterized REIPPPP as “the most successful public-private partnership in Africa in the last 20 years.” Important lessons can be learned for both South Africa and other emerging markets contemplating investments in renewables and other critical infrastructure investments},

abstract = {A cost model is developed for all vanadium and iron-vanadium redox flow batteries. Electrochemical performance modeling is done to estimate stack performance at various power densities as a function of state of charge and operating conditions. This is supplemented with a shunt current model and a pumping loss model to estimate actual system efficiency. The operating parameters such as power density, flow rates and design parameters such as electrode aspect ratio and flow frame channel dimensions are adjusted to maximize efficiency and minimize capital costs. Detailed cost estimates are obtained from various vendors to calculate cost estimates for present, near-term and optimistic scenarios. The most cost-effective chemistries with optimum operating conditions for power or energy intensive applications are determined, providing a roadmap for battery management systems development for redox flow batteries. The main drivers for cost reduction for various chemistries are identified as a function of the energy to power ratio of the storage system. Levelized cost analysis further guide suitability of various chemistries for different applications. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The annual solar irradiation on the earth provides more than 8,000 times the world’s energy requirements. Mathematically speaking, about 1 {\%} of the surface area of the Sahara Desert is sufficient in order to meet the world’s electricity requirements with solar thermal power plants. A solar thermal power plant was already constructed close to Cairo at the beginning of the 20th century. Using parabolic mirrors, the power plant captured and concentrated solar energy and used it to heat oil for boiling water. This in turn was used to drive steam turbines and produce electricity. The PS10 solar tower power plant, which is located near Seville in the Andalusia region of Spain, has been providing about 11 MW of power since 2007, as has the Nevada Solar One 64-MW plant in Nevada in the United States. The Andasol I-III complex, which consists of three 50-MW power plants located in the Spanish province of Granada, went on line two years later. The market was developing very rapidly at this time, but has now slowed down considerably in comparison with a few years ago. Although the German research facilities and companies in the field of solar thermal power generation belong to the world’s best, they are currently in a difficult environment. High investment costs, the associated financial restrictions and political instability, such as in the MENA region (Middle East {\&} North Africa), are just some of the reasons for this. Above all there is considerable competition with photovoltaics, since it is the price development that contributes to competitiveness. This means that it often takes considerable time for power plant projects to be implemented. On the other hand, a positive trend can also be seen, with new markets about to be tapped. 2.5 GW of solar thermal capacity is currently in operation and about 1.5 GW is currently under construction. The export-oriented key components developed in Germany, such as absorbers, collectors and mirrors, are being installed on a large scale in solar thermal power plants throughout the world. In addition, the news from Ouarzazate in Morocco shows that the expansion of solar thermal power plants is well under way. After all, they have long become standard practice. This Themeninfo brochure examines the basics of solar thermal plants, their technical components and their application potential, and shows examples from practice. Your BINE editorial team},

However, this planning paradigm is shifting, with increasing variable energy resource penetration, to consider system flexibility requirements in addition to peak capacity. Flexibility is broadly defined as the capability of system operators to respond to changing loads net of intermittent renewable generation. It can be provided by energy storage, but also by gas-fired generation, enhancement of existing resources, responsive loads, new or redefined ancillary services and operational rule changes. We show that traditional cost of new entry (CONE) capacity planning metrics fail to fairly represent the net cost of different types of flexible capacity resources. We contribute to existing literature by using a mixed integer linear program to (1) optimize the dispatch of three bulk energy storage technologies and a conventional combustion turbine (CT) and (2) co-optimize their dispatch as price-takers first in day-ahead and subsequently in real-time energy and ancillary service markets. We then define a "flexible capacity" CONE and demonstrate, that even without premium "pay-for-performance" payments, bulk energy storage can be cost competitive with a CT as a flexible resource in today's markets. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The 2012 edition of the World Energy Outlook was released on 12 November and presents authoritative projections of energy trends through to 2035 and insights into what they mean for energy security, environmental sustainability and economic development. Oil, coal, natural gas, renewables and nuclear power are all covered, together with an update on climate change issues. Global energy demand, production, trade, investment and carbon dioxide emissions are broken down by region or country, by fuel and by sector. WEO-2012 presents in-depth analysis of several topical issues, such as: the benefits that could be achieved if known best technologies and practices to improve energy efficiency were systematically adopted; the dependence of energy on water, including the particular vulnerabilities faced by the energy sector in a more water-constrained future; how the surge in unconventional oil and gas production in the United States is set to have implications well beyond North America; and a detailed country focus on Iraq, examining both its importance in satisfying the country’s own needs and its crucial role in meeting global oil and gas demand. Furthermore, it analyses the implications of energy trends on climate change, quantifies the cost of subsidies to fossil fuels and renewables, which are both coming under closer scrutiny in this age of austerity, and presents measures of progress towards providing universal access to modern energy services.},

@misc{EASAC2011,
abstract = {Concentrating solar power (CSP) sits alongside photovoltaic electricity generation as a commercially available renewable energy technology capable of harnessing the immense solar resource in Southern Europe, the Middle East and North Africa (the MENA region), and elsewhere. In CSP a high-temperature heat source is created by concentrating the sun’s rays to produce electricity in a thermodynamic cycle. This study by the European Academies Science Advisory Council has examined the current status and development challenges of CSP, and consequently has evaluated the potential contribution of CSP in Europe and the MENA region to 2050, and identiﬁ ed actions that will be required to enable that contribution to be realised. This report summarises the ﬁ ndings of the study and is intended to inform policy-makers in the European institutions – in particular the European Commission and Parliament – and policy-makers at a national level in Europe and the MENA region. There are various CSP technologies with different advantages and disadvantages, and CSP plants need to be designed to optimally meet local and regional conditions. Worldwide in 2011, 1.3 GW of CSP were operating and a further 2.3 GW were under construction. Currently, base-load electricity generated by CSP plants located where there are good solar resources costs two to three times that from existing fossil-based technologies without carbon capture and storage. CSP generation costs are on a par with photovoltaics and offshore wind, but are signiﬁ cantly more expensive than onshore wind. Provided that commercial deployments of CSP plants continue to grow, and that these deployments are associated with sustained research, development and demonstration programmes, CSP generating cost reductions of 50–60{\%} may reasonably be expected over the next 10–15 years. Allowing for some escalation in fossil fuel prices and incorporation of the costs of CO2 emissions in fossil generation costs (through carbon pricing mechanisms and/or requirements to install carbon capture and storage), it is anticipated that CSP should become cost competitive with base-load fossil-based generation at some point between 2020 and 2030. In speciﬁ c locations with good solar resources this point may be reached earlier. CSP plants that incorporate thermal storage and/or supplementary ﬁ ring offer additional potential beneﬁ ts beyond the value of the kilowatt-hours that they generate, as they can provide dispatchable power, helping the grid operator to reliably match supply and demand, and maintain grid stability. The value of this capability is context speciﬁ c, but increases as the proportion of electricity generated by variable renewable sources such as wind and photovoltaics increases. CSP with storage may therefore, in future, offer a cost-effective way of enabling the incorporation of substantial contributions of variable renewable sources in electricity systems. Environmental impacts of CSP plants are generally low, and may be expected to further improve compared to fossil-ﬁ red technologies over time given the relatively early stage of development of CSP. While the construction of CSP plants is more material intensive than fossil-ﬁ red plants, the required materials are mainly commonly available, and readily recyclable, materials such as steel, concrete and glass. Given the likely positioning of CSP plants in arid areas, their use of water, particularly for cooling, is an issue pointing to the need to improve the performance of air cooling systems. The solar resource in Southern Europe is such that CSP could provide a useful contribution to achieving Europe’s aim of a zero-carbon electricity system by 2050. Solar resources in the MENA region are even better, and far larger. Once CSP achieves cost parity with fossil- ﬁ red generation, these resources have the potential to transform the system of electricity generation in Europe and the MENA region. Around half of the anticipated reductions in CSP generating costs are expected to come from technology developments, and the other half from economies of scale and volume production. Well-designed incentive schemes will be needed, which reﬂ ect the real, timevarying value of generation so that CSP plants are appropriately designed, and which effectively drive research and development activities. The total amount of incentive payments that will be needed to achieve cost parity will depend crucially on how quickly costs reduce as installed capacity increases. Incentive schemes need to ensure that cost data are made available so that the learning rate, and its underlying drivers, can be established and monitored, and consequently energy strategies and incentive schemes can be adjusted as appropriate. Substantial investments will also be needed in transmission infrastructure, including high voltage direct current links between the MENA region and Europe, if substantial quantities of CSP electricity are to be exported from MENA countries to Europe. The development of CSP in the MENA region is a potentially signiﬁ cant component of initiatives to support low-carbon economic development and political progress in the region as reﬂ ected in the Barcelona Process, the Deauville Partnership, etc. CSP technologies (unlike some other renewable energy technologies) lend themselves to high levels of local-deliverables, well-matched to the capabilities of the workforce and industries in the region. Given the rapidly increasing demand for electricity in MENA countries, much of the electricity generated by CSP plants in the MENA region over the short to medium timescale may, and should, be expected to be used locally rather than exported to Europe, thus avoiding the construction of fossil-ﬁ red capacity in the MENA region. Financing schemes, and associated political agreements between the EU and MENA countries, will be needed to enable these short to medium timescale developments. Without ﬁ nancial commitment in the order of billions of euros from Europe, renewable energy technologies including CSP are unlikely to develop quickly in the MENA region. The challenge is to take a co-ordinated approach, simultaneously addressing the different bottlenecks (investment protection, energy policy incentives, research and development (R{\&}D), etc.), and to identify options which lower the barriers to entry for other actors (manufacturers, ﬁ nance companies, etc.). For this purpose, a transformation process should be deﬁ ned that addresses the technical, political and socio-economic factors necessary to achieve integration of EU and MENA energy systems and to strengthen the implementation of renewable options in the MENA region. Co-funding and co-ﬁ nancing options for CSP in the MENA region should be developed by the EU at a substantial scale as part of its neighbourhood policy. Incentive schemes in Europe and MENA countries should reﬂ ect the true value of electricity to the grid, effectively drive R{\&}D, and ensure transparency of cost data. R{\&}D should be funded at EU and national levels to complement commercially funded research. Funding schemes should ensure that market realities are strong drivers of R{\&}D, and that new technologies can progress rapidly from the laboratory, through pilot and demonstration scales, to commercial application. Further system-simulation studies should be undertaken to look at interaction effects for different shares of renewable energy sources at EU, MENA and EU–MENA levels of power system integration. Understanding from these studies, together with data on the learning rates of CSP and photovoltaics technologies, should be used to guide the development of the optimal mix to harness solar resources. Capacity-building initiatives should be put in place to support sustainable growth of the necessary technological skills in the relevant countries and regions. Such initiatives may include developing international networks of universities and industrial companies, and programmes for technology transfer from research to industry.},

With the successful installation of an indoor prototype in 2011, the assembly concept and optical performance was validated. In the second half of 2012, a demonstration loop consisting of two collectors with 3,400 m2 total aperture area, has been assembled and integrated into a commercial plant in the US. The loop is in operation since January 2013. The present paper presents the first experiences and especially the very promising performance results of the demonstration loop. Cost savings and related reduction of levelized costs of electricity (LCOE) are illustrated.},

abstract = {This study reviews existing life-cycle inventory (LCI) results for cradle-to-gate (ctg) environmental assessments of lead-acid (PbA), nickel-cadmium (NiCd), nickel-metal hydride (NiMH), sodium-sulfur (Na/S), and lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. LCI data are evaluated for the two stages of cradle-to-gate performance: battery material production and component fabrication and assembly into purchase ready batteries. Using existing production data on battery constituent materials, overall battery material production values were calculated and contrasted with published values for the five battery technologies. The comparison reveals a more prevalent absence of material production data for lithium ion batteries, though such data are also missing or dated for a few important constituent materials in nickel metal hydride, nickel cadmium, and sodium sulfur batteries (mischmetal hydrides, cadmium, ??-alumina). Despite the overall availability of material production data for lead acid batteries, updated results for lead and lead peroxide are also needed. On the other hand, LCI data for the commodity materials common to most batteries (steel, aluminum, plastics) are up to date and of high quality, though there is a need for comparable quality data for copper. Further, there is an almost total absence of published LCI data on recycled battery materials, an unfortunate state of affairs given the potential benefit of battery recycling. Although battery manufacturing processes have occasionally been well described, detailed quantitative information on energy and material flows are missing. For each battery, a comparison of battery material production with its manufacturing and assembly counterpart is discussed. Combustion and process emissions for battery production have also been included in our assessment. In cases where emissions were not reported in the original literature, we estimated them using fuels data if reported. Whether on a per kilogram or per watt-hour capacity basis, lead-acid batteries have the lowest cradle-to-gate production energy, and fewest carbon dioxide and criteria pollutant emissions. The other batteries have higher values in all three categories. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The challenge of transforming entire economies is enormous; even more so if a country is as fossil fuel based and emission intensive as South Africa. However, in an increasingly carbon constrained world and already now facing climate change impacts South Africa has to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity soon and decidedly. The South African electricity sector is a vital part of the economy and at the same time contributes most to the emissions problem. First steps have been taken by the South African government to enhance energy efficiency and promote renewable energy, however, they fail to show large-scale effects. This paper seeks to identify the relevant barriers to renewable energy investments and, based on experience from other countries, provide policy recommendations.The major barrier identified in the paper is based on the economics of renewable energy technologies, i.e. their cost and risk structures, two main factors in investment planning. As a solution, the South African government introduced several renewable energy support measures, such as a feed-in tariff. The paper discusses the potential and possible shortcomings of this and other existing support schemes and identifies complementing measures on a national scale. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In this paper a survey of the various types of solar thermal collectors and applications is presented. Initially, an analysis of the environmental problems related to the use of conventional sources of energy is presented and the benefits offered by renewable energy systems are outlined. A historical introduction into the uses of solar energy is attempted followed by a description of the various types of collectors including flat-plate, compound parabolic, evacuated tube, parabolic trough, Fresnel lens, parabolic dish and heliostat field collectors. This is followed by an optical, thermal and thermodynamic analysis of the collectors and a description of the methods used to evaluate their performance. Typical applications of the various types of collectors are presented in order to show to the reader the extent of their applicability. These include solar water heating, which comprise thermosyphon, integrated collector storage, direct and indirect systems and air systems, space heating and cooling, which comprise, space heating and service hot water, air and water systems and heat pumps, refrigeration, industrial process heat, which comprise air and water systems and steam generation systems, desalination, thermal power systems, which comprise the parabolic trough, power tower and dish systems, solar furnaces, and chemistry applications. As can be seen solar energy systems can be used for a wide range of applications and provide significant benefits, therefore, they should be used whenever possible. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Concentrating solar power with thermal energy storage (CSP-TES) is a unique source of renewable energy in that the solar thermal energy can be dispatched similarly to conventional thermal generation. However, CSP-TES plants are energy-limited, meaning that their response might be restricted by solar availability. Therefore, the use of this limited solar energy must be optimally scheduled to provide the greatest value to the system. The timing of CSP-TES dispatch depends on a variety of factors, including electricity demand patterns, the penetration of variable generation sources, and the configuration of the CSP-TES plant itself. We use an established CSP-TES modeling framework in a commercially available production cost model to compare the dispatch and value of two CSP-TES technologies (molten salt towers and parabolic troughs) in a Colorado test system. In addition, we consider a range of configuration parameters, such as the solar multiple and thermal energy storage limit, to evaluate how the operational and capacity value varies with plant configuration.},

abstract = {Technical and financial evaluations are important in assessing the feasibility and commercial applicability of energy storage technologies in integrated power systems. There are a number of available renewable energy component modeling software packages such as PVSyst and OpenWind, together with integrated power system modeling programs, including SimPowerSystem and HOMER Micropower Optimization software. This chapter discusses the technical and financial benefit of integrating a lead-acid and vanadium redox battery into off-grid power systems using one of the models, namely the HOMER Micropower Optimization Model software package. Two case studies were evaluated, including one small system to demonstrate the modeling process and one large, to show large-scale systems and the battery systems integration considerations for storage in power-integrated systems. The studies simulated the solar energy input, wind power input, and load on the power system. This enabled optimization of the capacity of the battery systems required to meet the system load requirements. The results show the considerable financial and environmental benefits of installing a battery system. Actually, by simulating different alternatives in the same conditions, the use of battery systems for energy storage, as opposed to a diesel generator, not only leads to considerable cost savings but also to annual CO2 reductions.},

@article{Zakeri2015,
abstract = {Large-scale deployment of intermittent renewable energy (namely wind energy and solar PV) may entail new challenges in power systems and more volatility in power prices in liberalized electricity markets. Energy storage can diminish this imbalance, relieving the grid congestion, and promoting distributed generation. The economic implications of grid-scale electrical energy storage technologies are however obscure for the experts, power grid operators, regulators, and power producers. A meticulous techno-economic or cost-benefit analysis of electricity storage systems requires consistent, updated cost data and a holistic cost analysis framework. To this end, this study critically examines the existing literature in the analysis of life cycle costs of utility-scale electricity storage systems, providing an updated database for the cost elements (capital costs, operational and maintenance costs, and replacement costs). Moreover, life cycle costs and levelized cost of electricity delivered by electrical energy storage is analyzed, employing Monte Carlo method to consider uncertainties. The examined energy storage technologies include pumped hydropower storage, compressed air energy storage (CAES), flywheel, electrochemical batteries (e.g. lead–acid, NaS, Li-ion, and Ni–Cd), flow batteries (e.g. vanadium-redox), superconducting magnetic energy storage, supercapacitors, and hydrogen energy storage (power to gas technologies). The results illustrate the economy of different storage systems for three main applications: bulk energy storage, T{\&}D support services, and frequency regulation.},

abstract = {To properly evaluate the prospects for commercially competitive battery electric vehicles (BEV) one must have accurate information on current and predicted cost of battery packs. The literature reveals that costs are coming down, but with large uncertainties on past, current and future costs of the dominating Li-ion technology1–3 . This paper presents an original systematic review, analysing over 80 different estimates reported 2007–2014 to systematically trace the costs of Li-ion battery packs for BEV manufacturers.We show that industry-wide cost estimates declined by approximately 14{\%} annually between 2007 and 2014, from above US{\$}1,000 per kWh to around US{\$}410 per kWh, and that the cost of battery packs used by market-leading BEV manufacturers are even lower, at US{\$}300 per kWh, and has declined by 8{\%} annually. Learning rate, the cost reduction following a cumulative doubling of production, is found to be between 6 and 9{\%}, in line with earlier studies on vehicle battery technology2 . We reveal that the costs of Li-ion battery packs continue to decline and that the costs among market leaders are much lower than previously reported. This has significant implications for the assumptions used when modelling future energy and transport systems and permits an optimistic outlook for BEVs contributing to low-carbon transport.},

The areas are assumed suitable if they get sufficient sunshine, are close enough to transmission lines, are flat enough, their respective vegetation is not under threat and they have a suitable land use profile. Various maps are created showing the solar resource, the slope, areas with "least threatened" vegetation, proximity to transmission lines and areas suitable for the installation of large concentrating solar power plants. Assuming the installation of parabolic trough plants, it is found that the identified suitable areas could accommodate plants with a nominal capacity of 510.3 GW in the Northern Cape, 25.3 GW in the Free State, 10.5 GW in the Western Cape and 1.6 GW in the Eastern Cape, which gives a total potential nominal capacity of 547.6 GW for the whole country. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The report starts with an overview of power tower technology, including the progression from Solar One to the Solar Two project. This discussion is followed by a review of the Solar Two project--what was planned, what actually occurred, what was learned, and what was accomplished. The third section presents preliminary information regarding the likely configuration of the next molten-salt power tower plant. This section draws on Solar Two experience as well as results of continuing power tower development efforts conducted jointly by industry and Sandia National Laboratories. The fourth section details the expected performance and cost goals for the first commercial molten-salt power tower plant and includes a comparison of the commercial performance goals to the actual performance at Solar One and Solar Two. The final section summarizes the successes of Solar Two and the current technology development activities. The data collected from the Solar Two project suggest that the electricity cost goals established for power towers are reasonable and can be achieved with some simple design improvements.},

@article{Noone2012,
abstract = {In this article, a new model and a biomimetic pattern for heliostat field layout optimization are introduced. The model, described and validated herein, includes a detailed calculation of the annual average optical efficiency accounting for cosine losses, shading and blocking, aberration and atmospheric attenuation. The model is based on a discretization of the heliostats and can be viewed as ray tracing with a carefully selected distribution of rays. The prototype implementation is sufficiently fast to allow for field optimization. Parameters are introduced for the radially staggered layout and are optimized with the objective of maximizing the annual insolation weighted heliostat field efficiency. In addition, inspired by the spirals of the phyllotaxis disc pattern, a new biomimetic placement heuristic is described and evaluated, which generates layouts of both higher insolation-weighted efficiency and higher ground coverage than radially staggered designs. Specifically, this new heuristic is shown to improve the existing PS10 field by 0.36{\%} points in efficiency while simultaneously reducing the land area by 15.8{\%}. Moreover, the new pattern achieves a better trade-off between land area usage and efficiency, i.e., it can reduce the area requirement significantly for any desired efficiency. Finally, the improvement in area becomes more pronounced with an increased number of heliostats, when maximal efficiency is the objective. While minimizing the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) is typically a more practical objective, results of the case study presented show that it is possible to both reduce the land area (i.e. footprint) of the plant and number of heliostats for fixed energy collected. By reducing the capital cost of the plant at no additional costs, the effect is a reduction in LCOE. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {To identify suitable sites in the Republic of South Africa for short-, medium- and long-term implementation scenarios for concentrating solar power (CSP) plants, geographical information system (GIS) technology was used by the researchers. An area was assumed suitable if it receives a satisfactory amount of annual irradiation; is close enough to suitable transmission substations; the transmission lines feeding these substations adhere to certain criteria; the area is flat enough; there are sustainable water sources close by; and it has a suitable landuse. For immediate implementation, various sites near substations in the provinces of the Free State-, Northern Cape- and North West- in South Africa were identified. DNI-levels at sites in the Northern Cape, for instance, reached levels of up to 2900 kWh/m2 /a. In the medium-term, a number of high-voltage transmission line- and substation projects that are currently under development or construction in the Northern Cape will strengthen the energy grid in this province significantly, and will substantially increase the viable CSP-areas. It will further increase the current generation limit of the transmission system in the Northern Cape from 1129 MW to an estimated figure up to 3000 MW. For long-term planning, several additional areas were identified that are not currently viable. In this scenario it is assumed that low-water consumption technologies, such as the Brayton Cycle Central Receiver, will become commercially viable.},

abstract = {The world is not on track to meet the target agreed by governments to limit the long- term rise in the average global temperature to 2 degrees Celsius (°C). Global greenhouse- gas emissions are increasing rapidly and, in May 2013, carbon-dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmosphere exceeded 400 parts per million for the ?rst ?me in several hundred millennia. The weight of scien??c analysis tells us that our climate is already changing and that we should expect extreme weather events (such as storms, ?oods and heat waves) to become more fre?uent and intense, as well as increasing global temperatures and rising sea levels. Policies that have been implemented, or are now being pursued, suggest that the long-term average temperature increase is more likely to be between 3.6 °C and 5.3 °C (compared with pre-industrial levels), with most of the increase occurring this century. ?hile global ac?on is not yet su?cient to limit the global temperature rise to 2 °C, this target s?ll remains technically feasible, though extremely challenging. To keep open a realis?c chance of mee?ng the 2 °C target, intensive ac?on is re?uired before 2020, the date by which a new interna?onal climate agreement is due to come into force. Energy is at the heart of this challenge: the energy sector accounts for around two-thirds of greenhouse-gas emissions, as more than 80? of global energy consump?on is based on fossil fuels.},

Results show that heliostats in the range of approximately 25 to 40 m2 have a substantially lower cost per unit area than the current base line 148 m2 heliostat considered by the US Department of Energy (DOE), based on their cost data. The analysis is based on allocating costs into three categories: a constant cost per unit area; a cost per unit area that is dependent on the imposed load on the structure, drive units, etc., as a function of area; and a cost that is essentially fi xed, irrespective of heliostat size.},

Characteristics include both technology cost and technology performance projections to the year 2050. Cost parameters include installed capital costs and operation and maintenance (O{\&}M) costs. Performance parameters include plant size, heat rate, capacity factor or availability factor, and plant lifetime. Conventional, renewable, and emerging electricity generating technologies were considered. Six data sets, each associated with a different model, were selected. Two of the data sets represent modeled results, not direct model inputs. These two data sets include cost and performance improvements that result from increased deployment as well as resulting capacity factors estimated from particular model runs; other data sets represent model input data. For the technologies contained in each data set, the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) was also evaluated, according to published cost, performance, and fuel assumptions.},

@article{Bradshaw2002,
abstract = {Solar Two was a collaborative, cost-shared project between 11 U. S. industry and utility partners and the U. S. Department of Energy to validate molten-salt power tower technology. The Solar Two plant, located east of Barstow, CA, comprised 1926 heliostats, a receiver, a thermal storage system, a steam generation system, and steam-turbine power block. Molten nitrate salt was used as the heat transfer fluid and storage media. The steam generator powered a 10-MWe (megawatt electric), conventional Rankine cycle turbine. Solar Two operated from June 1996 to April 1999. The major objective of the test and evaluation phase of the project was to validate the technical characteristics of a molten salt power tower. This report describes the significant results from the test and evaluation activities, the operating experience of each major system, and overall plant performance. Tests were conducted to measure the power output (MW) of the each major system, the efficiencies of the heliostat, receiver, thermal storage, and electric power generation systems and the daily energy collected, daily thermal-to-electric conversion, and daily parasitic energy consumption. Also included are detailed test and evaluation reports.},

abstract = {The IEA, which was established in November 1974, has over the years gained recognition as one of the world’s most authoritative sources for energy statistics. Its all-encompassing annual studies of oil, natural gas, coal, electricity and renewables are indispensable tools for energy policy makers, companies involved in the energy field and scholars. In 1997 the IEA produced a handy, pocket-sized summary of key energy data. This new edition responds to the enormously positive reaction to the books since then. Key World Energy Statistics from the IEA contains timely, clearly-presented data on the supply, transformation and consumption of all major energy sources. The interested businessman, journalist or student will have at his or her fingertips the annual Australian production of coal, the electricity production in Japan, the price of diesel oil in Spain and thousands of other useful energy facts. Gathering and analysing statistics is one of the important IEA functions. But the Agency – an autonomous body within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development – also: administers a plan to guard member countries against the risk of a major disruption of oil supplies coordinates national efforts to conserve energy and develop alternative energy sources, as well as to limit pollution and energy-related climate change disseminates information on the world energy market and seeks to promote stable international trade in energy.},

@article{Kearney2002,
abstract = {An evaluation was carried out to investigate the feasibility of utilizing a molten salt as the heat transfer fluid (HTF) and for thermal storage in a parabolic trough solar field to improve system performance and to reduce the levelized electricity cost. The operating SEGS1 plants currently use a high temperature synthetic oil consisting of a eutectic mixture of biphenyl/diphenyl oxide. The scope of this investigation included examination of known critical issues, postulating solutions or possible approaches where potential problems existed, and the quantification of performance and electricity cost using preliminary cost inputs. The two leading candidates were the so-called solar salt (a binary salt consisting of 60{\%} NaNO3 and 40{\%} KNO3) and a salt sold commercially as HitecXL (a ternary salt consisting of 48{\%} Ca(NO3)2, 7{\%} NaNO3, and 45{\%} KNO3). Assuming a 2-tank storage system and a maximum operation temperature of 450°C, the evaluation showed that the levelized electricity cost can be reduced by 14.2{\%} compared to a state-of-the-art parabolic trough plant, such as the SEGS plants in California. If higher temperatures are possible, the improvement may be as high as 17.6{\%}. Thermocline salt storage systems offer even greater benefits. 1},

@article{Desideri2014,
abstract = {Solar energy is a source, which can be exploited in two main ways to generate power: direct conversion into electric energy using photovoltaic panels and by means of a thermodynamic cycle. In both cases the amount of energy, which can be converted, is changing daily and seasonally, causing a discontinuous electricity production. In order to limit this drawback, concentrated solar power plants (CSP) and photovoltaic plants (PV) can be equipped with a storage system that can be configured not only for covering peak-loads but also for the base-load after the sunset or before the sunrise. In CSP plants it is the sun's thermal energy to be stored, whereas in PV applications it is the electrical energy to be stored in batteries, although this is not economically and environmentally feasible in large-scale power plants.The main aim of this paper is to study the performance of concentrated solar power plants equipped with molten salts thermal storage to cover a base load of 3MWel. In order to verify the possibility of storing effectively the thermal energy and to design a plant for base load operation, two locations were chosen for the study: Gela in southern Italy, and Luxor in Egypt. The electricity production of the CSP facilities has been analyzed and then compared with the electricity production of PV plants. Two different comparisons were done, one by sizing the PV plant to provide the same peak power and one using the same collectors surface. This paper has also highlighted some important issues in site selection and in design criteria for CSP plants used for base load operation.The high variability of the direct normal radiation during the year in southern Italy may cause several problems in CSP facilities, mainly related to the wide range of energy input from the sun. The more uniform and higher values of the solar radiation in the Egyptian location mitigates this problem and allows achieving higher efficiencies than in southern Italy. In most cases the electricity produced by the CSP plant is higher than that produced by a similar PV plant, because the presence of the storage system guarantees the continuity of electricity production even without solar radiation. An economic analysis based on the estimation of the levelized electricity cost (LEC) for both CSP and PV power plants located both in south of Italy and Egypt was carried out in order to investigate which is the most cost effective solution. In all the cases considered, the CSP facilities resulted the best option in terms of cost of electricity produced due to the continuity of energy production during the night hours. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Since they constitute {\~{}}50{\%} of the capital cost of the plant it is important to reduce heliostat cost as much as possible to improve the economic performance of power towers. In this study we evaluate current heliostat technology and estimate a price of {\$}126/m2 given year-2006 materials and labor costs for a deployment of {\~{}}600 MW of power towers per year. This 2006 price yields electricity at {\$}0.067/kWh and hydrogen at {\$}3.20/kg. We propose research and development that should ultimately lead to a price as low as {\$}90/m2, which equates to {\$}0.056/kWh and {\$}2.75/kg H2. Approximately 30 heliostat and manufacturing experts from the United States, Europe, and Australia contributed to the content of this report during two separate workshops conducted at the National Solar Thermal Test Facility.},

abstract = {Large-scale solar power plants are being developed at a rapid rate, and are setting up to use thousands or millions of acres of land globally. The environmental issues related to the installation and operation phases of such facilities have not, so far, been addressed comprehensively in the literature. Here we identify and appraise 32 impacts from these phases, under the themes of land use intensity, human health and well-being, plant and animal life, geohydrological resources, and climate change. Our appraisals assume that electricity generated by new solar power facilities will displace electricity from traditional U.S. generation technologies. Altogether we find 22 of the considered 32 impacts to be beneficial. Of the remaining 10 impacts, 4 are neutral, and 6 require further research before they can be appraised. None of the impacts are negative relative to traditional power generation. We rank the impacts in terms of priority, and find all the high-priority impacts to be beneficial. In quantitative terms, large-scale solar power plants occupy the same or less land per kW h than coal power plant life cycles. Removal of forests to make space for solar power causes CO2 emissions as high as 36 g CO2 kW h-1, which is a significant contribution to the life cycle CO2 emissions of solar power, but is still low compared to CO2 emissions from coal-based electricity that are about 1100 g CO2 kW h-1. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Concentrating solar power (CSP) technologies continue to mature and are being deployed worldwide. Power towers will likely play an essential role in the future development of CSP due to their potential to provide dispatchable solar electricity at a low cost. This Power Tower Technology Roadmap has been developed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to describe the current technology, the improvement opportunities that exist for the technology, and the specific activities needed to reach the DOE programmatic target of providing competitively- priced electricity in the intermediate and baseload power markets by 2020. As a first step in developing this roadmap, a Power Tower Roadmap Workshop that included the tower industry, national laboratories, and DOE was held in March 2010. A number of technology improvement opportunities (TIOs) were identified at this workshop and separated into four categories associated with power tower subsystems: solar collector field, solar receiver, thermal energy storage, and power block balance of plant. In this roadmap, the TIOs associated with power tower technologies are identified along with their respective impacts on the cost of delivered electricity. In addition, development timelines and estimated budgets to achieve cost reduction goals are presented. The roadmap does not present a single path for achieving these goals, but rather provides a process for evaluating a set of options from which DOE and industry can select to accelerate power tower R{\&}D, cost reductions, and commercial deployment.},

abstract = {Lifetime estimation of lead-acid batteries in stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) systems is a complex task because it depends on the operating conditions of the batteries. In many research simulations and optimisations, the estimation of battery lifetime is error-prone, thus producing values that differ substantially from the real ones. This error can indicate that the "optimal" system selected by the optimisation tool will not be optimal. In this paper, all of the components of a PV system have been considered simultaneously to simulate the behaviour of the system. One of these important components is the battery charge controller, which significantly affects the lifetime of batteries. The results of the simulations have allowed a comparison of the most common methods of battery lifetime prediction used by simulation and/or optimisation tools with a weighted Ah-throughput method developed a few years ago. The results show that this recent method provides more accurate lifetime values. In a simulation of a real off-grid household PV system where the real battery lifetime was 6.2. years, the weighted Ah-throughput model predicted a lifetime of 5.8. years; however, the other methods obtained lifetimes of more than 15. years. In a simulation of another PV system designed to supply the load of an alarm where the real batteries lifetime was 5.1. years, the weighted Ah-throughput model predicted a lifetime of 4.4. years; however, the other methods obtained lifetimes of more than nine years. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},
